Tasks can be moved across statuses using drag-and-drop functionality powered by Angular Material CDK, allowing seamless management of task progress through dynamic columns. Additional features include the ability to create epics, define issue types, and invite team members to collaborate on projects. Users can also create new accounts and assign roles based on responsibilities, ensuring a role-based access structure. This project highlights my expertise in building robust frontend solutions and integrating them with backend services for a fully functional task management platform.',
