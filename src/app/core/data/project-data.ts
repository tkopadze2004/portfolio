      'Developed a Task Manager application using Angular 18 with a NestJS backend. The platform allows users to authenticate and create projects, where they can organize tasks within customizable kanban-style boards. Users can register tasks, assign them to different statuses using drag-and-drop functionality powered by Angular Material CDK, and manage task progress through dynamic columns. Additional features include the ability to create epics, define issue types, and invite team members to collaborate on projects. Users can also create new accounts and assign roles based on responsibilities, ensuring a role-based access structure. This project demonstrates my ability to integrate frontend and backend technologies to deliver a fully functional task management solution.',
